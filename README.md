# History Book Club
A web application where users can have discussions about great history books.

Purpose:
This is a project to help me practice creating web applications, working with both the front- and back-end. I enjoy history, books, and discussions, so I thought I'd try to create something that involves those things.

Technology:
I'm starting the project with ASP.NET, but I plan to create a future version using something else (possibly Django or Ruby on Rails) to help me practice with a new framework, and also because my current hosting provider does not support ASP.NET.

Desired Features:
  - Books will act as discussion categories containing various discussion topics
  - Users can create posts in various topics
  - Users can reply to other posts, create multiple threads within a topic
  - Users can up or down vote a post
  - Users can register an account with a login name and password
  - Users can create profiles that contain and link to the discussions they're involved in
  - Verification and validation of posts (users can't post without logging in, for example)
  - Flagging of inappropriate content
  
Possibilities in the Future:
  - This app is limited to history books, but could possibly introduce more themes or book categories
  - Currently there will be one administrator for the app who can add books and topics for discussion, but could allow users to create their own topics, maybe vote on books they'd like      to see added.
